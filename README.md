GUI based 6-band Audio Equalizer in MATLAB

A GUI based 6-band Audio Equalizer in MATLAB has sliders for:
• Frequencies less than 200 Hz
• Frequencies between 200 Hz-1 kHz
• Frequencies between 1 kHz -2 kHz
• Frequencies between 2 kHz-3 kHz
• Frequencies between 3 kHz-4 kHz
• Frequencies greater than 4 kHz

This equalizer is able to:
1. Browse audio files available on the system and plot the audio signal with respect to time.
2. Play, pause, and stop the selected audio file.
3. Plot single-sided frequency spectrum of the audio signal.
4. Adjust the gain of each frequency band and display the impact of this adjustment on
input signal. For instance, if the gain for the frequencies less than 200 Hz is increased
by using the slider, the frequency spectrum plot should show this increase in gain.
5. Play the new audio file with the desired adjustments and plot this signal with respect
to time.
